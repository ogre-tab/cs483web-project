While having denser muscle mass does increase one's overall strength, someone of average physical strength who uses 100% of their muscular capability may be capable of overpowering someone with [[Peak Human Strength]] (who would be using the normal percentage).\n*In some verses, using 100% of one's muscular strength can increase one's physical capabilities a hundredfold, but at the same time, it could cost a person their life.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gyanza_Rujike_Muscle.png|Gyanza Rujike (Black Cat) using all of his ki onto his muscles, increasing himself to his max.\nFile:Frieza_100%.jpg|Frieza (Dragon Ball) bulking himself up to 100%, reaching the strongest of his natural form.\nTrunksFutureUltraSuperSaiyan-Ep164.png|Using Super Saiyan Third Grade, Trunks (Dragon Ball) removes all of his body's natural inhibitors, allowing him to use 100% of his muscular strength.\nTenryū_Kokyū_Hō.jpg|Using ''Tenryū Kokyū Hō'', Kenshiro (Fist of the North Star) taps into his full muscular strength.\nShizuo2.jpg|Because he was born without any of the mental limiters necessary to restrain muscle strength, Shizuo Heiwajima (Durarara) is able to use the full 100% of his strength at all times.\nFile:Might_Guy_(Naruto)_Night_Guy.gif|Might Guy (Naruto) opened all Eight Gates, releasing every bit of his muscle's power to the point of distorting space.\nFile:Younger_Tugoro_100%_Full_Power.png|Younger Toguro (Yu Yu Hakusho) raising his muscular strength to 100%, requiring him to feed on souls to maintain his strength...\nFile:Younger_Toguro_at_120%.png|...and while forcing his muscle's strength to go to 120%, caused a fatal strain that led to his demise.\nBelial and Zagan magic combination.png|Hakuryuu (Magi the Labyrinth of Magic) can use both Zagan and Belial's life magic to draw out the maximum strength of his soldiers...\nBerserker soldiers.png|...giving them berserker like physical power.\nAikawa super punch.gif|As a zombie, Aikawa Ayumu (Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka) can draw out more than 100% of his muscular power.\n100% Percent Muscle by Mou Bu Kingdom.png|''Great General'' Mou Bu (Kingdom) utilizing his Full Strength during his duel with Kan Mei,'' the Giant of Chu''.\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Powers]]\n[[Category:Supernatural Powers]]\n[[Category:Personal Physical Powers]]\n[[Category:Enhancements]]\n[[Category:Peak Powers]]\n[[Category:Fighting Power]]\n[[Category:Bodily Functional Powers]]\n[[Category:Combat Powers]]\n[[Category:Non-Fighting Power]]\n[[Category:Cellular Manipulation]]\n[[Category:Common Powers]]\n[[Category:Real Powers]]"
